**Description**

A math simulator app that allows you to strengthen your arithmetic skills: adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing.

The arithmetic expression is written in a raindrop that falls into the sea. The answer is entered on the panel with numbers. You must enter the answer before the drop falls.
